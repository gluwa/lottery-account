# Prize Linked Account

Prize Linked Account for sUSDC-G holders.

Read [Luniverse Gluwacoin](https://github.com/gluwa/Luniverse-Gluwacoin) for details.

## What is Prize Linked Account?

Users' funds will be deposited into a collective liquidity pool which will earn interest daily at a rate of 4% APY. At the end of the daily prize period, a randomized draw takes place where the winner earns all the interest earned by the liquidity pool. The more you deposit into the prize pool, the greater your odds of winning.

Functionally, the Prize-linked Savings Account functions as a no-loss lottery, meaning you receive lottery tickets at no cost, and your deposit stays the same until you withdraw. Your funds are withdrawable from the pool at any time.
